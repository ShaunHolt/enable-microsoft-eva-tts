# Enable Microsoft Eva Mobile (Cortana) TTS voice 

## Prerequisites

* You may* need to change your Windows 10 language to English (US)
* You may* need to setup Cortana (Windows Settings or Windows Cortana App) with English (US)

*These settings cannot be toggled easily, so I am not sure whether they are necessary. 

To enable Microsoft Eva Mobile: 

1. Click on `Microsoft-Eva-Mobile.reg` to add the Eva Mobile voice to the registry.
2. Open a PowerShell window as admin.
3. Copy all of `Enable-Microsoft_Eva_Mobile.txt` into the PowerShell window.

This should do the trick and the Eva Mobile should be available to TTS programs. 

You can test all available TTS voices by copying all of `Test-Microsft_Eva_Mobile.txt` into the PowerShell window.
